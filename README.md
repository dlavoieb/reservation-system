# Reservation System

Multi-process synchronization exercise modeled around a reservation system 

## Build

Clone the repository

```bash
cd reservation-system
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ..
```

At this point, there is a new folder created in the root of the project, `bin` that contains the compiled executables. You can run them directly or run the test bash script.
